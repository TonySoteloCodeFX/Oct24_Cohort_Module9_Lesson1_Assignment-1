<h2>1. Designing a User-Friendly Product Registration Page in Figma</h2>

<b>Objective:</b> The aim of this assignment is to design a highly intuitive and visually appealing product registration page for a bakery using Figma. This registration page should not only align with the brandâ€™s aesthetic (feel free to be creative in creating a unique brand identity if you wish) but also offer a seamless user experience that encourages new users to register their products/baked goods.

<b>Problem Statement:</b> Users often face product registration processes that are cumbersome and poorly designed, leading to frustration and a potential loss of customers. A well-designed product registration page should simplify the process, encourage user completion, and ultimately drive up the registration numbers.

<h3>Task 1:</h3>

Research and analyze existing product registration forms to identify common design patterns and user pain points. Pinterest is a great resource for collecting visual ideas or doing a simple Google search. Also, think about what information would be pertinent to ask of the user in registering their baked goods to the site. 

<h3>Task 2:</h3>

Create low-fidelity wireframes for the product registration page that organize the necessary fields into a logical, user-friendly layout. Focus on a user interface's basic structure and layout, using simple shapes, placeholders, and basic text. This can be done in Figma. 

<h3>Task 3:</h3>

From your selected wireframe develop a high-fidelity prototype in Figma of the product registration page incorporating the wireframe layout, company branding, and all UI elements.

<b>Expected Outcomes:</b>

- <b>Task 1:</b> A list that outlines best practices in product registration design and a list of identified user pain points. You can add this to the final Figma Prototype with just 2 seperate bulleted lists. 
<br>

- <b>Task 2:</b> 2-3 wireframes that demonstrate the layout and flow of the registration process. These should be clear enough that someone unfamiliar with the project can understand the proposed user journey.
<br>

- <b>Task 3:</b> A completed Figma prototype that visually communicates the final design, ready for feedback, testing, or development handoff.
